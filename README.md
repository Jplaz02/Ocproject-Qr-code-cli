# Ocproject - QR Code CLI 🧾

This is a simple Node.js command-line tool that generates QR codes from user input. It’s part of my **Ocproject** series — a collection of small, intentional builds as I deepen my backend skills.

## 🚀 What It Does

- Accepts a string from the command line
- Generates a QR code using the `qrcode` npm package
- Displays the QR code in the terminal or saves it to a file

📚 What I Learned
Using third-party packages in Node.js

Handling command-line arguments

Structuring a small CLI utility

Documenting projects for clarity and reuse

✍️ Notes
This project is based on a course example, but I’ve added my own structure and documentation. It’s part of my journey to rebuild my coding foundation with real understanding.
